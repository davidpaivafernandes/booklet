# booklet
A powershell script to create booklet from a PDF document

Not all printer drivers have this feature available so I thought it would be usefull to make one.

I use it to make printed books of some PDF books that interests me and that I want to keep in printed form.

I use normally 32 pages booklets but you're free to use whatever size suits your needs. Mind that must be a multiple of 4.

In the media folder are some pictures of some of the book I've made with this thing.

The final PDF can be printed completely selecting two pages per side, front&back by the shorter size.
